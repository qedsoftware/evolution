## Admin panel vs standard interface

If possible use standard interface. It is simple and safe.

Admin panel is only for advanced superuser operations. It is by design very close to being 1-1 with database. It means that it is possible to achieve non-standard settings and modify data in unrestricted way. This can prove useful when handling complaints for instance - you could make a retrospective submission if it is justified. Or post-factum change which submissions are selected. But this also is also allows you to make incredible mess. So be careful.

## Adding News

For now you have to do it from the admin interface. Once you are there, use "+" sign to add the content. Don't alias the same content across multiple news items.
You can later modify the content.

## Global Message & Footer

It's very similar to adding news, only that there is exactly one System Settings object that allows setting global message and footer in the same way as content in news.
