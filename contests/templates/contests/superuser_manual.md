## Admin Panel vs standard interface

If possible use the standard interface. It is simple and quite safe.

*Admin Panel* is only for advanced superuser operations.
It is by design very close to being 1-1 with database.
It means that it is possible to achieve non-standard settings and modify the data in an unrestricted way.
This can prove useful when handling complaints, for instance.
You can make a retrospective submission or change which submissions are selected after the contest.
Of course this also allows you to make incredible mess. So be **careful**.

## Adding News

For now you have to do it from the admin panel.
Once you are there, use "+" sign to add the content. Don't alias the same content across multiple news items.
You can later modify the content.

## Global Message & Footer

It's very similar to adding news, only that there is exactly one System Settings object that allows setting global message and footer in the same way as content in news.
